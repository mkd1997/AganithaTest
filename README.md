# AganithaTest

## Code Walkthrough
In this project I create an abstract class X which is extended by classes A, B, C. The project provides the user with a menu and allows him/her to create or delete class objects or run the execute method.
The code is designed in such a way that it can track the number of times the execute method is called for each object as well as each class.

## Running the code
There are 2 methods to run the program:
1. The code can be directly imported as a IntelliJ IDEA project and can be run from there.
2. Go to out/production and run the following command on command line:        *java com.mkd.Main*
